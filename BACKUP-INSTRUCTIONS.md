# 📦 Complete Backup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ All data is synced between localhost and online (Supabase)
✅ Build is successful and deployed
✅ Ready for complete backup

## How to Create a Complete Backup

### Option 1: Browser Console (Recommended)
1. Open your app (online or localhost)
2. Log in as admin
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Copy the entire contents of `backup-all-data.js`
5. Paste into console and press Enter
6. The backup will:
   - Download as JSON file automatically
   - Save to localStorage with timestamp
   - Show summary of backed up data

### Option 2: Manual Backup
1. Export Supabase data manually from Supabase dashboard
2. Export localStorage data from browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage

## What Gets Backed Up

### Supabase Data:
- ✅ Compositions (all user compositions)
- ✅ Progressions (all user progressions)
- ✅ Lessons (all global lessons)
- ✅ User Progress (lesson completion status)
- ✅ Shared Items (shared compositions/progressions)

### LocalStorage Data:
- ✅ innato-compositions
- ✅ innato-progressions
- ✅ innato-lessons
- ✅ innato-lesson-progress
- ✅ innato-favorites
- ✅ innato-user-session
- ✅ deleted-composition-ids
- ✅ deleted-lesson-ids
- ✅ innato-categories
- ✅ innato-composer-draft

## After Backup

Run cleanup script to remove old backups and unnecessary files:
```bash
./cleanup-backups.sh
```

This will:
- Keep only the most recent backup files
- Remove old temporary test files
- Remove old SQL files
- Remove old setup scripts
- Remove old documentation files
- Keep essential files (README, migrations, configs)

## Backup File Location

The backup file will be:
- Downloaded to your Downloads folder: `innato-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Saved in localStorage with key: `backup-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-sssZ`

## Restore Instructions

To restore from backup:
1. Import the JSON file
2. Use the restore script (to be created if needed)
3. Or manually import data back to Supabase/localStorage
